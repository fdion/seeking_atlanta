Seeking Exotics (novelties, anomalies etc) notebooks from datascicon Atlanta

### Seeking Exotics: A Story of Visualization and Model Based Anomaly Detection

This repository contains updated notebooks and requirements of my [seeking_exotics](https://github.com/fdion/seeking_exotics) github repo.

One reason for creating a brand new repository is that mpld3 hasn't kept up with the latest python modules, and specifically with matplotlib. In this version, I've replaced it with cufflinks (which adds the .iplot method to pandas dataframe).

### The building blocks

 - [numpy](http://numpy.org)
 - [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
 
### The statistical packages
 
 - [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html)
 - [statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
 
### The machine learning
 
 - [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
 - [scikit-sos](https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/scikit-sos)
 - [lsanomaly](https://github.com/lsanomaly/lsanomaly)
 
### The visualization

 - [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
 - [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)
 - [Stemgraphic](http://stemgraphic.org)
 - [cufflinks](https://github.com/santosjorge/cufflinks)
 - [plotly](https://plot.ly)

### Learn more

During my talk, I brought up a few paper and book titles (the first 12). I also talked about a few more during the 
questions at the end (and later). So for the benefit of many, here are some of 
them (_related to outliers, anomalies, statistics, AI and visualization_):

 the Most Likely Induction (1777), translated from latin by C. G. Allen, republished in Biometrika 48, 1 and 2 p.1

There are a few differences from the list of books in my previous seeking exotics repo, so [check it out](https://github.com/fdion/seeking_exotics) too.
